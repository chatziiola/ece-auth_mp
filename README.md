# Description
Essentially this repository tracks our teams approach to the microprocessors course, during the 8th semester of the E.C.E. A.U.Th. study program.

# Contents
- [Lab 1](lab1): This was about writing in assembly, utilizing assembly within c and using UART to print information.

- [Lab 2](lab2)
- [Lab 3](lab3)
